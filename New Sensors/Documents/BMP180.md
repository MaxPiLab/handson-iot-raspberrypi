## BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor
This pressure sensor is a BMP-180 based digital barometric pressure sensor module and is functional compatible with older BMP-085 digital pressure sensor with less power consumption smaller in size and more accurate. BMP180 combines barometric pressure, temperature and altitude. The I2C allows easy interface with any microcontroller. On board 3.3V LDO regulator makes this board fully 5V supply compatible. BMP-180 can measure pressure range from 300 to 1100hPa (+9000m to -500m relating to sea level) with an accuracy down to 0.02hPa (0.17m) in advance resolution mode. BMP-180 is an improved replacement for BMP-085 sensor. BMP-180 uses piezo-resistive technology for high accuracy, linearity, EMC robustness and stability for a longer period of time.

### Working of BMP180
The BMP180 consists of a piezo-resistive sensor, an analog to digital converter and a control unit with E2PROM and a serial I2C interface. The BMP180 delivers the uncompensated value of pressure and temperature. The microcontroller sends a start sequence to start a pressure or temperature measurement. After converting time, the result value (pressure or temperature respectively) can be read via the I2C interface. For calculating temperature in °C and pressure in hPa, the calibration data has to be used. These constants can be read out from the BMP180 E2PROM via the I2C interface at software initialization. The sampling rate can be increased up to 128 samples per second (standard mode) for dynamic measurement. In this case, it is sufficient to measure the temperature only once per second and to use this value for all pressure measurements during the same period

### STORY
In this project we will be measuring the Temperature, Pressure and Altitude using the BMP180 Pressure sensor. It is small in size and can be used in various projects very easily. The module consists of a silver colored box like structure with a hole on top. Inside this box lies two pieces of silicon which help in measuring the various attributes and some fiber glass. It does not contain any of the passive elements inside it such as the resistor, capacitor or inductor. One of the two pieces of silicon is a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) which helps in measuring the pressure by creating a diaphragm. The other piece of silicon is a microcontroller. These two pieces are connecting through wires present on top of MEMS silicon piece. The size of these silicon pieces are in millimeters.  
The connections are fairly simple as there are only four wires that are to be connected to the raspberry pi. The pressure sensor uses I2C interface to communicate with the Pi. The connections of the pressure sensor to the Pi is as follows:

|**PIN** | **NAME** | **REMARKS** | **RPi PIN** |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | V~cc | 3.3V Power Supply | 1 |
| 2 | GND | Ground | 6 |
| 3 | SCL | Clock Pulse | 5 |
| 4 | SDA | Data | 3 |

After making the connections the program is run and the various attributes which the pressure sensor is capable of displaying are displayed on the output screen. The connections for the pressure sensor are shown in the circuit diagram below.

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Setting up the Hardware Part
1.	Insert the Micro SD card containing the Raspbian OS into the Raspberry Pi 3. (The slot for the Micro SD is at the bottom of the Pi.)
1.	Connect the Raspberry Pi 3 to a monitor (output device) with the help of a HDMI cable. (If your monitor is VGA type then you should have a HDMI to VGA converter.) 
2.	Connect the mouse and keyboard (input devices) in the USB slots provided (4 slots)
3.	Power up the Pi by connecting it to a power supply and wait for the Raspbian OS to load (This may take some time)
4.	Make the connections as per the circuit diagrams. (You can make the connections before connecting the input and output devices as well)

#### Running the program
1.	Click on the main menu and go to preferences. Hover the mouse over preferences and select **Raspberry Pi configuration**
2.	Enable the I2C interfacing from the interface tab of the configuration menu
3.	To check which channel the sensor is using, type the following command in the LX Terminal **sudo i2cdetect –y 1** 
4.	If you receive and error message then change the one (1) to zero (0) i.e. **sudo i2cdetect –y 0**

5.	If the sensor is detected a channel number will be allotted to the sensor in order to retrieve the information from the sensor. In the above case the sensor has been alotted the channel 77. 
6.	Download the [code](https://github.com/11RO05/handson-iot-raspberrypi/blob/master/New%20Sensors/src/BMP.py) provided in the GitHub repository. The code provided uses a library file which is also present in the same repository. Click [here](https://github.com/11RO05/handson-iot-raspberrypi/blob/master/New%20Sensors/src/BMP085.py) to open the library file.
7.	Create a new folder and keep both the library file and the program code in the same folder. 
8.	Open IDLE 3.5 from the programming menu and open the program code.
9.	To run the code either press **F5** or run the program from the run menu of the IDLE window
10.	Observe the output in the output window and vary the temperature and the pressure to see the visible changes.
